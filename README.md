QuantumAuth is an open-source, hardware-anchored, post-quantum authentication platform.  
This monorepo contains the official SDKs used to integrate QuantumAuth into web and server-side applications.

QuantumAuth delivers device-bound identity using TPM modules, Secure Enclave, and post-quantum signatures — creating an authentication system that is invisible to users, impossible to phish, and resistant to next-generation threats.

### **@quantumauth/web**
